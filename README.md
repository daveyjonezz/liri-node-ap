# liri-node-ap

## Overview
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## How it works
User (the person running the program) will enter - node liri.js _command-prompt_ - in the terminal. 
The possible command prompts include: **movie-this**, **concert-this**, **spotify-this-song**, and **do-what-it-says**.

* For movie-this, the user will need to enter a **movie title**. 
* For concert-this, the user will need to enter a **band name**. 
* For spotify-this-song, the user will need to enter a **song title**. 
* For do-what-it-says, the user will need to edit the accompanying random.txt file using the formatting in the file.
